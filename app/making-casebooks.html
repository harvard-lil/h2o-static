    <h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
    <p>H2O helps law faculty make digital casebooks that are free, simple to update and easy to access and print.</p>
    <p>All of the content on H2O is free to access and covered by a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license</a>. </p>

    <h3 id="accounts">Sign Up</h3>
    <p>To make casebooks you'll need an account. <a href="https://opencasebook.org/accounts/new/">Sign up for free here</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you login, your account menu will appear in the upper right corner, and from there you can access your profile and dashboard or you can sign out.</p>

    <h3 id="profiles">Your Profile</h3>
    <p>Complete your profile by adding your display name and your school.</p>

    <h2 id="creating-casebooks">Creating a Casebook</h2>
    <p>Click the "Create Casebook" button at the top of the page to get started.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/create-casebook-button.png" alt="A screenshot of the top of the page, with the Create Casebook button highlighted.">
    </figure>
    <p>There are two ways to create a casebook on H2O. You can build a new casebook from scratch or you can adapt an existing casebook.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/create-casebook-modal.png" alt="A screenshot of the Create Casebook modal, which offers two options for making a casebook.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="from-scratch">Building from Scratch</h3>
    <p>Building a new casebook from scratch is easy. There are many different ways to do it, but here's a method we like and recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Add a title.</li>
        <li>2. Add the sections and sub-sections that form the basic structure of your casebook.</li>
        <li>3. Add the resources (cases, texts, links) you want to each section.</li>
        <li>4. Annotate individual resources using elisions, highlights, links and notes.</li>
        <li>5. Publish your casebook</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Read on <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/making-casebooks/#titles">below</a> to learn more about each of these steps.</p>

    <h3 id="adapting-casebooks">Adapting Existing Casebooks</h3>
    <p>To adapt an existing casebook, search our database of casebooks for the one you want to use as a starting point. You can search by keyword (like "Torts" or by author (like "Zittrain"). </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/search-results.png" alt="A screenshot of the search page.">
    </figure>
    <p>Select the casebook you want to adapt, then click the "Clone" button to create your own draft version of the casebook.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/clone-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, with the 'Clone' button highlighted.">
    </figure>
    <p>Once you've cloned the casebook to create your own draft version, you can make changes by adding or deleting sections or resources, and by making your own annotations.</p>

    <h2 id="titles">Titles</h2>
    <p>You can edit the title of your casebook and add a subtitle and headnotes by clicking on "Casebook" tab. Hit the Save button after making any changes to these fields.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/adding-titles.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the title, subtitle and headnotes form.">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="quick-add">Quick Add</h2>

    The Quick Add tool is a powerful, multi-purpose form that lets you quickly add many different types of content in a variety of ways. It's located at the bottom of the table of contents for your casebook.
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/quickadd-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the quick add form below an empty table of contents.">
    </figure>

    Using Quick Add, you can add sections, cases, links and texts to your casebook. You can also clone casebooks, or parts of other casebooks on opencasebook.org:

    <br />

    <table id="quickadd-reference">
        <tr>
            <th>Adding Multiple Items at Once</th>
            <th>Adding Single Items</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>
                    Start by pasting into the form an outline, syllabus or list copied from Word, Google Docs or some other source (PDFs not so much).
                </p>
                <p>
                    H2O will try to recognize the pasted items and automatically convert them into casebook sections, cases and links.
                </p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>
                    Start by pasting or typing the title of your entry. If it’s a case, type the case name or citation. Or type the URL for the link.
                </p>
                <p>
                    H2O will try to recognize the item you want to add and automatically select the correct type before adding it to the casebook.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Adding Items Directly from H2O
            </th>
            <th>
                Adding Cases Directly from CAP
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>
                    To add other casebooks, or parts of other casebooks, to your own, grab the URL for the part you want to add, and paste it into the Quick Add form.
                </p>

                <p>
                    H2O will automatically “clone” the content for you and add it to your casebook.
                </p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <p>
                    To add cases directly from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP), grab the URL for the case from https://cite.case.law and paste it into the Quick Add form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    H2O will automatically ingest the case from CAP and add it to your casebook.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />
    <h3 id="finalize-entries">Finalize your entries</h3>
    <p>
        H2O will automatically add your entries at the bottom of your draft casebook. You should review them and make any edits. H2O will use a red outline to highlight entries it needs a little help completing, and you can quickly access these using the “Finalize Entries” button.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/finalize-entries-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the finalize entries button in the top right">
    </figure>
    <br />

    <p>
        For any item, you can use the drop-down menu to switch type - such as from “case” to “text” or from “text” to “section.” You also can drag-and-drop to move items within the casebook. And you can click on an item to edit its title or content.
    </p>

    <p>
        For cases, if H2O is unable to match the given citation or case name, you’ll need to click “Specify Case” and then use the search tool to select the case you want. If you don’t see your case in the search results, you can also search by citation, or if you’ve already found the case on CAP, you can paste a link to it in the search field. If you still don’t see your case, we likely don’t have it in our database. You’ll need to mark the entry as a “text” and then add it manually.
    </p>


    <h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>

    <h3 id="new-sections">Making New Sections</h3>
    <p>Sections form the structure of your casebook. To add a section, click the "Add Section" action button, and then fill in the section title, as well as any section subtitle or headnotes. Click "Save" when you're finished updating the title, subtitle and headnotes. The Section will initially appear at the bottom of your casebook contents, but you can move a section by clicking and holding your mouse button, then dragging and dropping it into the desired location. </p>
    <h3 id="adapting-sections">Adapting Sections from Other Casebooks</h3>
    <p>You also copy sections from other public casebooks and incorporate them into your casebook. </p>
    <p><i>Check out our videos on <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/#creating-sections-video">making sections</a> and <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/#moving-items-video">moving items</a>.</i></p>

    <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
    <p><i>Check out our video on adding resources <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/#adding-resources-video">here</a>.</i></p>
    <p>Resources form the content of your casebook. To add a resource to your casebook, click the "Add Resource" action button.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-resource-button.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the title, subtitle and headnotes form, with the add resource action button highlighted">
    </figure>

    <p>Then select the type of resource you want to add. H2O currently supports three resource types: (1) Cases; (2) Texts; and (3) Links.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-resource.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook contents page, showing the title, subtitle and headnotes form, with the add resource form activated.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="adding-cases">Cases</h3>
    <p>Cases are opinions issued by courts. H2O supplies them. You can search our database for the citation of the one you want. When you click the case within the search results, H2O will add it to your casebook. If the case you want is not appearing in search results, let us know and we'll add it to the database. </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-case.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook, with the add resource form active, the find case tab active, and a citation entered with results showing.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="adding-texts">Texts</h3>
    <p>Texts are resources created by users. Often these are introductory or explanatory notes prepared by the author to offer context about a case. They also can include questions, problem sets, statutory references or any other content the author adds. To add a text, simple use the text editor form to include and style your content.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook, with the add resource form active, the create text tab active, and some sample text entered.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="adding-links">Links</h3>
    <p>Links are resources that point to materials hosted elsewhere on the web. These can be websites, government reports, articles, blogposts, etc. </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-link.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook, with the add resource form active, the add link tab active, and an example URL entered.">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="cloning-content">Cloning Content</h2>
    <p>H2O allows you to clone and adapt entire casebooks, but it also lets you clone and adapt individual sections, cases, texts and links. Simply visit the content you want to clone and click the "Clone" button.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/clone-section.png" alt="A screenshot of a section of a casebook, with the Clone Section button highlighted.">
    </figure>
    <p>Then you'll be shown a list of your own draft casebooks. Select the casebook to which you'd like to add the cloned material.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/clone-recipient.png" alt="A screenshot of the modal with a listing of casebooks to which the user can send the cloned section.">
    </figure>
    <p>Once you've added the cloned section or resource to your casebook, you can move it around or edit it however you like.</p>

    <h2 id="annotating-resources">Annotating Resources</h2>
    <p><i>Watch our how-to video on making annotations <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/#annotating-video">here</a>.</i></p>
    <p>Once you've added a case or text resource to your casebook, you can make several different types of annotations, including eliding text, replacing text, higlighting text, adding comments to selected text and adding links to selected text. Annotations can only be added to a casebook that you have permission to edit, and is in draft mode. This part of the guide walks you through each type of annotation.</p>

    <h3 id="elisions">Elisions</h3>
    <p>Authors often want to hide text that is not essential to the casebook, such as portions of cases that discuss unrelated issues or factual or procedural background. With H2O, authors can use elisions to hide any unnecessary text. Here is an example of an elision: </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elided-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case from which some text has been elided.">
    </figure>

    <p>H2O hides the text but readers can view the hidden text by simply clicking on the ellipsis.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/view-hidden-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case revealing the previously hidden text.">
    </figure>

    To make an elision, select the desired text, then use the annotation menu that pops up in the right margin to choose the "Elide."

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elide-menu.png" alt="A screenshot of a case with text selected for elision and the annotation menu with the elide option highlighted.">
    </figure>

    <p>H2O then will hide that text, marking the elision with an ellipsis.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elision-complete.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the successful elision of certain text.">
    </figure>

    <p>To remove the elision, click the edit icon in the right margin and select "Remove elision." </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/remove-elision.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to remove elisions.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="replacement-text">Replacing Text</h3>
    <p>To maintain readability, authors often want to replace elided text with their replacement text that paraphrases the hidden content or supplies needed transition words. H2O supports this through annotations that allow authors to supply replacement text for elided passages. </p>
    <p>To use this type of annotation, simply select the text you want to hide and then choose "Replace" from the annotation menu.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/replace-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to add replacement text in place of a hidden text passage.">
    </figure>

    <p>You'll then be prompted to type your replacement text into a form. When you're finished, press enter:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/enter-replacement-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to add replacement text in place of a hidden text passage.">
    </figure>

    <p>To remove or edit the replacement text, click the edit icon in the right margin and use the menu.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/remove-replacement-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to remove replacement text or restore the original text.">
    </figure>


    <h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
    <p>Highlights work just as you would expect. Select the desired text, pick "Highlight" from the annotation menu, and H2O will apply a yellow background color to the selected text. </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/highlight-menu.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to highlight text.">
    </figure>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/highlighted-text.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing an example of highlighted text.">
    </figure>

    <p>To remove highlighting, click the edit icon in the right margin and select "Remove highlighting."</p>

    <h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
    <p>H2O allows authors to attach notes to selected passages in any case or text resource. To add a comment, as with other annotations, select the desired text, then pick "Add note" from the annotation menu.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-note.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to attach notes to text.">
    </figure>

    <h3 id="links">Links</h3>
    <p>H2O allows authors to attach external links to selected passages in any case or text resource. To add a link, select the desired text, then pick "Add link" from the annotation menu and enter the URL, then press enter.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-link-annotation.png" alt="A screenshot of a case showing the menu that allows authors to attach links to text.">

    <h2 id="publishing-casebooks">Publishing a Casebook</h2>
    <p><i>Watch a short video on publishing your casebook <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/#publishing-video">here</a>.</i></p>
    <p>While you're working on your casebook, it remains in "Draft" mode, indicated by the yellow banner at the top of the page and by the draft label on your dashboard.</p>
    <p>When you're ready to share the book publicly, click the "Publish" button visible to the right of the contents.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/publish-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a draft casebook's contents page showing the Publish button on the right side of the page.">
    </figure>
    <p>If H2O needs a little more information before it can publish your casebook, the Publish button will instead be a Finalize entries button, <a href="#finalize-entries"> detailed above.</a></p>
    <p>Once a casebook is published, it's freely accessible to everyone online, and it can be copied, modified and adapted by any accountholders. In addition, if you're a verified author, your published casebook will appear in search results on H2O.</p>
    <p>You also can "unpublish" a casebook. Go to the casebook and click the "Settings" tab, and then click the "Unpublish" button to remove it from public view. It then will be available on your dashboard as a private, editable casebook that you can later publish again if you wish.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/unpublish-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a published casebook's settings tab showing the Unpublish button in the middle of the page.">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="collaborating">Collaborating</h2>
    <p>
        Multiple authors and editors can work on a casebook together. You can invite other people to collaborate on a casebook at any time on the settings page, by supplying their email address.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/invite-collaborator.png" alt="A screenshot of a published casebook's settings page showing the email field for inviting a new collaborator.">
    </figure>
    <p>
        Invited collaborators will receive an email letting them know and will be able to view the casebook even if it is private. You may also allow them to edit the casebook, give them attribution so that their name appears in the list of authors, or remove them as collaborators. If you would like to hand off a casebook completely to your collaborators, you may do so by clicking the "Remove yourself from this casebook" button. Any collaborator that can edit the casebook has access to the casebook settings page, and can invite and manage collaborators.

    <p>H2O enables authors to revise published casebooks at any time. While you're working on a revised draft, your original published casebook remains publicly available. When you're done making changes, you can publish your revised casebook, and it will replace the prior version.</p>

    <h3 id="making-changes">Making Changes</h3>
    <p>To revise a casebook, click the "Revise" button to the right of the casebook contents:</p>

    </figure>

    <p>H2O will create a draft version of the published casebook, which you can modify however you like. Until you publish the revised version of your casebook, your working draft will appear in your dashboard as a yellow banner over the blue, published casebook. Click the yellow banner to access the draft, and click anywhere else on the casebook image to access the published version.

    <h3 id="publishing-changes">Publishing Changes</h3>
    <p>When you're done making changes, click the "Publish" button, and H2O will substitute the new, revised version of your casebook for the prior version.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Please note that H2O currently does not maintain copies of prior versions of casebooks. If you want to ensure that an existing version is not replaced, then you should clone the published casebook and create a new casebook rather than revise the existing casebook.</p>

    <p>If you're ready to export/print your casebook, visit the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/printing-casebooks">Printing Casebooks</a> section of this help guide.</p>

    <h2 id="grouping-editions">Grouping multiple editions</h2>
        <p>You can group multiple editions of the same casebook together to direct students to the most current one. Your dashboard has a <em>Manage Casebooks</em> link in the upper right corner.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/manage-casebooks.png" alt="A screenshot of the dashboard, with the manage casebook link highlighted.">
        </figure>
        <p>Clicking this will expose multiple options for managing your casebooks, and allow you to select casebooks by clicking on them. After you have selected all the editions of a casebook, click <em>Group selected</em>.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/group-selected.png" alt="A screenshot of the dashboard, with the group selected link highlighted.">
        </figure>
        <p>You'll then be able to provide a title, select the current edition, and group the casebooks on your dashboard.</p>

        <p>When a past edition of your casebook is viewed, a banner on top will alert viewers about the current edition.</p>

    <h2 id="archiving-casebooks">Archiving Casebooks</h2>
    <p>If you want to remove a casebook from your dashboard for any reason, you can archive it by clicking the "Settings" tab and then clicking the "Archive" button.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/archive-casebook.png" alt="A screenshot of a casebook's settings tab showing the archive button.">
    </figure>
    <p>Archived casebooks are not deleted from the database, but they're accessible to the public or visible on your dashboard. To access your own archived casebooks, click "[View Archived Casebooks]" on your dashboard.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>If you'd like to restore an archived casebook, click the "Unarchive" button on the "Settings" tab of the archived casebook. This will return it to your dashboard, and you can continue working with it from there.</p>
