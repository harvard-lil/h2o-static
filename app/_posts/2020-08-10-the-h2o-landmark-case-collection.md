The [H2O Landmark Case Collection](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/1199-h2o-landmark-case-collection/) is a series of open casebooks based on the [List of Landmark Court Decisions in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_landmark_court_decisions_in_the_United_States) on Wikipedia. 

Landmark cases are court decisions that change history, and law, on their ruling. This series contains 22 casebooks by topic and 250+ cases and resources made available by the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) at Harvard Law School Library and more. 

The H2O Landmark Case Collection was created with [H2O](https://opencasebook.org/), a platform for creating high quality, freely available online casebooks. Casebooks made available in this series can be used to create new resources in H2O - like [adapting](https://about.opencasebook.org/making-casebooks/#cloning-content) “Landmark Decisions: [Freedom of Speech and of the Press](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/1199-h2o-landmark-case-collection/sections/15-landmark-decisions-freedom-of-speech-and-of-the-press-cloned/)” to include your own [commentary and annotations](https://about.opencasebook.org/making-casebooks/#annotating-resources). 

We want this series to create building blocks for new open educational resources in law. Have you used H2O to create a new casebook, syllabus, or reading list? We’re excited to [hear about it](mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu).
